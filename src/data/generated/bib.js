        "abstract": "This study delves into the intricate intersection of human behavior, cognition, and technology within the cybersecurity domain, aiming to enhance our understanding of the human-centric challenges influencing the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures. The primary objective is to unravel the nuanced landscape where human errors persist as a significant contributing factor to security breaches, emphasizing the need for a holistic comprehension of human factors. The study recognizes the evolving nature of work, with an increasing number of individuals operating from home, and the consequential challenges in managing human factors in the digital era. The blurring lines between private and public lives, coupled with the rise of social credit systems, necessitate a thorough examination of key elements intersecting with cybersecurity  Employing a systematic literature review, this research methodically identifies, filters, and analyzes pertinent literature concerning human-centric factors in cybersecurity. The systematic approach involves the formulation of specific research questions guiding the study, strategic search plans targeting reputable databases, and meticulous study selection processes based on predefined criteria The study unfolds through a series of interconnected research questions, addressing the impact of human factors on operational efficiency, challenges in the adoption of human-centric approaches, and the ways in which human factors influence strategic decision-making in cybersecurity. The results shed light on the substantial contribution of understanding user behavior and cognitive processes to the development of tailored cybersecurity strategies. Challenges, such as security fatigue and the scarcity of psychology-based professionals, are addressed, advocating for human factors engineering and strategic initiatives to enhance education and training programs. In conclusion, embracing a human-centric paradigm emerges as imperative for organizations striving to fortify their defenses against dynamic and sophisticated cyber threats. Integrating technology with a profound understanding of human factors becomes the cornerstone for shaping a resilient and adaptive cybersecurity future.",

        "abstract": "Holistic assessment of cyber security risks is a complex multi-component and multi-level problem involving hardware, software, environmental, and human factors. As part of an on-going effort to develop a holistic, predictive cyber security risk assessment model, the characterization of human factors, which includes human behavior, is needed to understand how the actions of users, defenders, and attackers affect cyber security risk. The work group developing this new cyber security risk assessment model and framework has chosen to distinguish between trust and confidence by using \u201ctrust\u201d only for human factors, and \u201cconfidence\u201d for all non-human factors (e.g. hardware and software) in order to reduce confusion between the two concepts within our model. We have developed an initial framework for how to incorporate trust as a factor/parameter within a larger characterization of the human influences (users, defenders and attackers) on cyber security risk. Trust in the human factors is composed of two main categories: inherent characteristics, that which is a part of the individual, and situational characteristics, that which is outside of the individual. The use of trust as a human factor in holistic cyber security risk assessment will also rely on understanding how differing mental models and risk postures impact the level trust given to an individual and the biases affecting the ability to give said trust.",

        "abstract": "Cyber attacks have been increasingly detrimental to networks, systems, and users, and are increasing in number and severity globally. To better predict system vulnerabilities, cybersecurity researchers are developing new and more holistic approaches to characterizing cybersecurity system risk. The process must include characterizing the human factors that contribute to cyber security vulnerabilities and risk. Rationality, expertise, and maliciousness are key human characteristics influencing cyber risk within this context, yet maliciousness is poorly characterized in the literature. There is a clear absence of literature pertaining to human factor maliciousness as it relates to cybersecurity and only limited literature relating to aspects of maliciousness in other disciplinary literatures, such as psychology, sociology, and law. In an attempt to characterize human factors as a contribution to cybersecurity risk, the Cybersecurity Collaborative Research Alliance (CSec-CRA) has developed a Human Factors risk framework. This framework identifies the characteristics of an attacker, user, or defender, all of whom may be adding to or mitigating against cyber risk. The maliciousness literature and the proposed maliciousness assessment metrics are discussed within the context of the Human Factors Framework and Ontology. Maliciousness is defined as the intent to harm. Most maliciousness cyber research to date has focused on detecting malicious software but fails to analyze an individual\u2019s intent to do harm to others by deploying malware or performing malicious attacks. Recent efforts to identify malicious human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity, include analyzing motives driving insider threats as well as user profiling analyses. However, cyber-related maliciousness is neither well-studied nor is it well understood because individuals are not forced to expose their true selves to others while performing malicious attacks. Given the difficulty of interviewing malicious-behaving individuals and the potential untrustworthy nature of their responses, we aim to explore the maliciousness as a human factor through the observable behaviors and attributes of an individual from their actions and interactions with society and networks, but to do so we will need to develop a set of analyzable metrics. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to review human maliciousness-related literature in diverse disciplines (sociology, economics, law, psychology, philosophy, informatics, terrorism, and cybersecurity); and (2) to identify an initial set of proposed assessment metrics and instruments that might be culled from in a future effort to characterize human maliciousness within the cyber realm. The future goal is to integrate these assessment metrics into holistic cybersecurity risk analyses to determine the risk an individual poses to themselves as well as other networks, systems, and/or users.",

        "abstract": "[Background:] Security-by-design techniques (e.g., STRIDE) are used to elicit system threats before they are exploited. Since security threat assessment is performed on a conceptualised model of the system under analysis, human expertise is relied upon to exhaustively elicit all possible threats. To this end, the outcomes of threat analysis depend on the individual actors involved in the process. However, human expertise can be biased depending on certain or a combination of human factors. [Goal:] With this work, we aim to unveil the effect (if any) of human factors (e.g., gender, age, seniority, educational background, nationality) to security risk assessment. [Method:] To contribute to this body of knowledge, we are conducting a state-of-the-art literature review and several experiments with human participants (experts and non-experts) in the domain of security and risk assessment. First, the topic and technical domain are described in general. Second, preliminary results of the on-going literature review are presented. Finally, a research plan is described including research questions, treatment, and participant recruitment.",

        "abstract": "Cyber security risks are socio-technical in nature. They result not just from technical vulnerabilities but also, more fundamentally, from the degradation of working practices over time  which move an organization across the boundary of secure practice to a place where attacks will not only succeed, but also have a significantly greater impact on the organization. Yet current risk analysis and management methodologies are not designed to detect these kinds of systemic risks. We present an approach, devised in the field, to deriving these risks  using a qualitative research methodology, akin to grounded theory, but based on preset coding descriptors. This allows organizational and individual behavior identified during interviews, observations or document research to be thematically analyzed, collated and mapped to potential risks, linked to poor working practices. The resulting risk factors can be linked together forming risk narratives, showing how the degradation of working practices in one part of the organization can contribute to undermining its ability to respond to cyber security threats in another part of the organization.",

Accordingly, in this paper, we identify current research on psychological traits and individual differences among computer system users that explain vulnerabilities to cyber security attacks and crimes. Our review shows that computer system users possess different cognitive capabilities which determine their ability to counter information security threats. We identify gaps in the existing research and provide possible psychological methods to help computer system users comply with security policies and thus increase network and information security.",

Cybersecurity does not simply focus on information technology systems; it also considers how humans use information systems and susceptible actions leading to vulnerabilities. As cyber leaders begin to identify human behavior and processes and collaborate with individuals of the same mindset, an organization\u2019s strategy can improve substantially. Cybersecurity has been an expanding focal point from the viewpoint of human factors. Human inaccuracy can be unintentional due to an inaccurate strategic implementation or accurate unsatisfactory plan implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted to realize unintentional human factors in cybersecurity leadership. The results indicate that humans were the weakest link during the transmission of secure data. Furthermore, specific complacent and unintentional behaviors were observed, enabled by the ignorance of leaders and employees. Therefore, the enforcement of cybersecurity focuses on education, awareness, and communication. A research agenda is outlined, highlighting a further need for interdisciplinary research. This study adopts an original approach by viewing security from a human perspective and assessing how people can reduce cybersecurity incidents.",
